    These results demonstrate that many socially transitioned transgender youth experience levels of anxiety and
    depression in the normative range and equal to or only slightly higher than siblings and cisgender peers. Whether
    their generally strong mental health is because of their early social transition, the high levels of support they
    receive, or other factors is as yet unknown

    Our study provides quantitative evidence that access to PBs or GAHs in a multidisciplinary gender-affirming
    setting was associated with mental health improvements among TNB youths over a relatively short time frame of 1
    year. The associations with the highest aORs were with decreased suicidality<br>
    We observed 60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or
    GAHs compared with youths who had not. There was no association between PBs or GAHs and anxiety.

        https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.31919
    </a><br>
    Compared with standard care, the intervention group had a decrease in gender dysphoria, a clinically
    significant decrease in depression, and a significant decrease in suicidality. Resolution of suicidality assessed by
    PHQ-9 item 9 occurred in 11 individuals (52%) with immediate testosterone commencement compared with 1 (5%)
    receiving standard care.<br>
    In this open-label randomized clinical trial of testosterone therapy in transgender and gender-diverse adults,
    immediate testosterone compared with no treatment significantly reduced gender dysphoria, depression, and
    suicidality in transgender and gender-diverse individuals desiring testosterone therapy.

    The TGD patients prescribed GAHT had a 15% lower risk of past 2-week moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms across
    follow-up, compared with those not prescribed GAHT.<br>
    In this cohort study, being prescribed GAHT was associated with lower rates of moderate-to-severe
    depressive symptoms in this study of diverse TGD primary care patients from FQHCs. Findings support the mental
    health&ndash;promoting role of GAHT and contribute to the evidence base that GAHT is a medically necessary treatment
    that improves mental health outcomes longitudinally for TGD people for those who want it

    Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults

    </a><br>
    We found that top surgery was associated with significant improvement in chest dysphoria (measured by the CDM) 3
    months postoperatively; patients receiving surgery exhibited substantial decreases in CDM from presurgery to
    postsurgery and their reductions in CDM were significantly greater than those for patients who did not undergo top
    surgery. Top surgery also led to significant improvements in gender congruence (TCS) and body image satisfaction
    (BIS) at 3 months postoperatively. Surgical complications were minimal and comparable with those in adult
    patients<br>
    Top surgery in TGNB DFAB AYA is associated with low complication rates. Top surgery is associated with improved
    chest dysphoria, gender congruence, and body image satisfaction in this age group.

    Twenty-eight studies, including four randomized controlled trials and 24 longitudinal studies, evaluated health
    outcomes following gender-affirming care. Moderate to very low certainty evidence from these studies suggests
    gender-affirming care may improve quality of life, stigma, utilization of health services, and mental health. No
    studies identified significant negative outcomes or harms.

    Mental Health and Self-Worth in Socially Transitioned Transgender Youth

        https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2016.10.016
    </a><br>
    Transgender children reported depression and self-worth that did not differ from their matched-control or sibling
    peers, and they reported marginally higher anxiety. Compared with national averages, transgender children showed
    typical rates of depression and marginally higher rates of anxiety. Parents similarly reported that their
    transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups and rated their transgender
    children as having equivalent levels of depression<br>
    These findings are in striking contrast to previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially
    transitioned, which found very high rates of depression and anxiety.

    The Mental Health of Transgender Youth: Advances in Understanding

    </a><br>
    Studies from a variety of settings have demonstrated that transgender youth have increased rates of
    depression, suicidality and self-harm, and eating disorders. While these results are troubling, the first
    longitudinal study of patients undergoing comprehensive therapy for gender dysphoria has shown promising data to
    support the notion that appropriate medical treatment for gender-variant youth can lead to improved psychological
    functioning. Indeed, in clinical observations outlined by Spack et al.<a href="#h.b5obn3492bpc">[6]
</a>,
    psychological functioning for these patients improved with medical intervention, suggesting that &ldquo;psychiatric
    symptoms might be secondary to a medical incongruence between mind and body, not primarily psychiatric (p423).

    Chosen Name Use Is Linked to Reduced Depressive Symptoms, Suicidal Ideation, and Suicidal Behavior Among Transgender

        https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.02.003
    </a><br>
    An increase by one context in which a chosen name could be used predicted a 5.37-unit decrease in depressive
    symptoms, a 29% decrease in suicidal ideation, and a 56% decrease in suicidal behavior. Depressive symptoms,
    suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior were at the lowest levels when chosen names could be used in all four
    contexts.<br>
    For transgender youth who choose a name different from the one given at birth, use of their chosen name in multiple
    contexts affirms their gender identity and reduces mental health risks known to be high in this group.

    Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression and seriously considering suicide compared to those
    who wanted GAHT but did not receive it. For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent
    depression and of a past-year suicide attempt.<br>
    Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among
    transgender and nonbinary youth.<br>
    Our results indicate significant relationships between receipt of GAHT and lower suicidality among transgender and
    nonbinary youth.

    The World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association no longer classify gender dysphoria as a
    mental health disorder<br>
    The vast majority of TGE youths who transitioned socially remain stable in their gender identity during
    adolescence [<a href="#h.iztsipoxazu">16
</a>]. Likewise, most adolescents who receive
    hormone therapy for gender dysphoria continue to use these medications in adulthood [<a href="#h.3ce4gvo93hs1">8
</a>].
    Post-GAC regret is rare, occurring in approximately 0.3% of individuals [<a href="#h.iaabecfz5vsd">18
</a>].<br>
    Puberty blockers stall development of secondary sex characteristics and limit reproductive capacity while
    in use. When stopped, the effects are fully reversible and sexual development catches up to chronological age
    quickly [<a href="#h.26qewp74s0ps">21&ndash;24</a>].<br>
    Body dissatisfaction related to gender is correlated with disordered eating, whereby food restriction and
    low body weight may forestall distressing physical change [<a href="#h.r36u6hlllwi0">29&ndash;32</a>]. Comorbid
    eating disorders and gender dysphoria are associated with up to a 75% risk of suicidality [<a
        href="#h.r36u6hlllwi0">29</a>]. Medical aspects of gender-affirming care have a distinct impact on reducing
    suicidal ideation and remission of eating disorders [<a href="#h.1dll1k8fxnar">13</a>,<a

    TGD adolescents experience health inequities due in large part to gender minority stress and gender

</a>,<a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(24)00439-7/fulltext%23">4</a>]
    For instance, TGD youth have been found to experience higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicidality, and
    nonsuicidal self-harm when compared to cisgender youth. [<a

    A growing body of research has demonstrated that the current sociopolitical environment, rife with misinformation
    about TGD identities and active threats to the accessibility of GAC, is also negatively impacting TGD people&rsquo;s
    mental health, [<a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(24)00439-7/fulltext%23">7
</a>,<a
        href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(24)00439-7/fulltext%23">8

    Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of medical GAC interventions through the alleviation of

    One critique is that the data are often cross-sectional. While cross-sectional data can be useful for

    In addition to the effectiveness of these treatments in reducing distress, studies also indicate that GAC for TGD
    youth is safe, with side effects similar to general medical interventions. [<a

    Rates of detransition are very low and do not warrant blanket bans of interventions that effectively address gender
    dysphoria for a large percentage of this population.

    In our U.S.-based cohort of transgender and nonbinary youth treated with GAH, we found decreases in depression and
    anxiety symptoms and increases in positive affect and life satisfaction.<br>
    Gender minority stress is consistently associated with more negative mental health outcomes.<br>
    Youth who had not undergone substantial gender-incongruent puberty had higher scores for appearance
    congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction and lower scores for depression and anxiety at baseline than
    youth who had undergone substantial endogenous puberty.<br>
    In this 2-year study involving transgender and nonbinary youth, GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial
    functioning.

    There is a significant inverse association between treatment with pubertal suppression during adolescence and
