    These results demonstrate that many socially transitioned transgender youth experience levels of anxiety and
    depression in the normative range and equal to or only slightly higher than siblings and cisgender peers. Whether
    their generally strong mental health is because of their early social transition, the high levels of support they
    receive, or other factors is as yet unknown

    </a><br>
    Our study provides quantitative evidence that access to PBs or GAHs in a multidisciplinary gender-affirming
    setting was associated with mental health improvements among TNB youths over a relatively short time frame of 1
    year. The associations with the highest aORs were with decreased suicidality<br>
    We observed 60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or
    GAHs compared with youths who had not. There was no association between PBs or GAHs and anxiety.

    </a><br>
    Compared with standard care, the intervention group had a decrease in gender dysphoria, a clinically
    significant decrease in depression, and a significant decrease in suicidality. Resolution of suicidality assessed by
    PHQ-9 item 9 occurred in 11 individuals (52%) with immediate testosterone commencement compared with 1 (5%)
    receiving standard care.<br>
    In this open-label randomized clinical trial of testosterone therapy in transgender and gender-diverse adults,
    immediate testosterone compared with no treatment significantly reduced gender dysphoria, depression, and
    suicidality in transgender and gender-diverse individuals desiring testosterone therapy.

    The TGD patients prescribed GAHT had a 15% lower risk of past 2-week moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms across
    follow-up, compared with those not prescribed GAHT.<br>
    In this cohort study, being prescribed GAHT was associated with lower rates of moderate-to-severe
    depressive symptoms in this study of diverse TGD primary care patients from FQHCs. Findings support the mental
    health&ndash;promoting role of GAHT and contribute to the evidence base that GAHT is a medically necessary treatment

    </a><br>
    We found that top surgery was associated with significant improvement in chest dysphoria (measured by the CDM) 3
    months postoperatively; patients receiving surgery exhibited substantial decreases in CDM from presurgery to
    postsurgery and their reductions in CDM were significantly greater than those for patients who did not undergo top
    surgery. Top surgery also led to significant improvements in gender congruence (TCS) and body image satisfaction
    (BIS) at 3 months postoperatively. Surgical complications were minimal and comparable with those in adult
    patients<br>
    Top surgery in TGNB DFAB AYA is associated with low complication rates. Top surgery is associated with improved
    chest dysphoria, gender congruence, and body image satisfaction in this age group.

    Twenty-eight studies, including four randomized controlled trials and 24 longitudinal studies, evaluated health
    outcomes following gender-affirming care. Moderate to very low certainty evidence from these studies suggests

    Transgender children reported depression and self-worth that did not differ from their matched-control or sibling
    peers, and they reported marginally higher anxiety. Compared with national averages, transgender children showed
    typical rates of depression and marginally higher rates of anxiety. Parents similarly reported that their
    transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups and rated their transgender
    children as having equivalent levels of depression<br>
    These findings are in striking contrast to previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially
    transitioned, which found very high rates of depression and anxiety.

    Studies from a variety of settings have demonstrated that transgender youth have increased rates of
    depression, suicidality and self-harm, and eating disorders. While these results are troubling, the first
    longitudinal study of patients undergoing comprehensive therapy for gender dysphoria has shown promising data to
    support the notion that appropriate medical treatment for gender-variant youth can lead to improved psychological
    functioning. Indeed, in clinical observations outlined by Spack et al.
    <a href="#10.1542/peds.2015-3223">[6]</a>,
    psychological functioning for these patients improved with medical intervention, suggesting that &ldquo;psychiatric
    symptoms might be secondary to a medical incongruence between mind and body, not primarily psychiatric (p423).

    Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression and seriously considering suicide compared to those
    who wanted GAHT but did not receive it. For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent
    depression and of a past-year suicide attempt.<br>
    Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among
    transgender and nonbinary youth.<br>
    Our results indicate significant relationships between receipt of GAHT and lower suicidality among transgender and

    We found that an average of 5 years after their initial social transition, 7.3% of youth had retransitioned at least
    once. At the end of this period, most youth identified as binary transgender youth (94%), including 1.3% who
    retransitioned to another identity before returning to their binary transgender identity. A total of 2.5% of youth
    identified as cisgender and 3.5% as nonbinary. Later cisgender identities were more common among youth whose initial
    social transition occurred before age 6 years; their retransitions often occurred before age 10 years.
    These results suggest that retransitions are infrequent. More commonly, transgender youth who socially transitioned
    at early ages continued to identify that way.

    Prevalence of Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors in Transgender Individuals With Eating Disorders: A National
    Study

<p>
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.07.016">

    </a><br>
    Due to the irreversible, high cost of death by suicide, as well as research indicating that a past attempt is a
    robust predictor of eventual death by suicide [23], this finding warrants urgent attention. Our results indicate
    that the combination of these two identities, both of which are associated with increased SITB rates, has a
    compounding effect.
    Results of this study have important clinical implications. First, medical and mental health professionals should be
    aware of the prevalence of SITBs in transgender individuals with EDs. Our results suggest the average college-aged
    transgender individual with an ED has more likely than not engaged in NSSI, had thoughts of suicide, and attempted
    suicide in the past year. As such, professionals caring for these individuals should be sure to assess and monitor
    risk regularly. Results also point to a need for treatment approaches tailored to this population. Treatments such
    as dialectical behavioral therapy, which directly addresses suicide and self-injury and has been utilized in the
    treatment of EDs [24], may merit consideration as a first-line treatment for such individuals. Additionally, body
    dysphoria may be a contributor in need of particular clinical attention. Body image disturbance is a core component
    of ED diagnoses [25], but transgender individuals report finding “typical” body image work in ED treatment
    ineffective and dismissive of their experiences [19]. It is important for clinicians to consider that body
    dissatisfaction in transgender individuals with EDs may require a different approach than the acceptance-based
    techniques utilized with cisgender individuals with EDs. Notably, gender-confirming medical interventions have been
    associated with reduced gender dysphoria, ED symptomology, and suicidality, and increased body satisfaction, in
    transgender individuals [19,26,27].
    More research is needed to fully understand the development, purpose, and prevalence of SITBs in this population.
    Body dissatisfaction in transgender individuals has been connected to both disordered eating and attempted suicide
    [28]. Desire for weight change (both gain and loss) is also associated with suicide attempts in transgender youth,
    suggesting this connection is a product of gender and body dysphoria [5]. It may be that transgender individuals
    develop EDs when they manipulate their diets in an attempt to make their bodies align with their desired gender
    identity [17–19]. Over time, limited success in doing this may produce feelings of shame and anger toward and
    disconnection from the body, leading them to increase disordered eating behaviors and/or to engage in SITBs.
    Muehlenkamp suggested that low body regard (a person's perception of and attitude toward the body) facilitates
    engagement in self-injury [29]. Animosity toward the body, found in both those with EDs and transgender individuals,
    may be compounded through the combination of these identities, resulting in especially high propensity toward SITBs.
    Research exploring the methods and body locations of self-injury in transgender individuals with and without EDs and
    questioning participants about the function of their self-injurious behaviors could be enlightening. These
    questions, as well as items about body-related attitudes, could elucidate the contribution of body dysphoria to
    SITBs in this population. It may be that dysphoria leads to devaluation of and objectification of the body,
    facilitating both EDs and SITBs.

    <a href="#10.1037/sgd0000081">4</a>]
    For instance, TGD youth have been found to experience higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicidality, and
    nonsuicidal self-harm when compared to cisgender youth.

    A growing body of research has demonstrated that the current sociopolitical environment, rife with misinformation
    about TGD identities and active threats to the accessibility of GAC, is also negatively impacting TGD people&rsquo;s
    mental health

    <a href="#10.1007/s13178-021-00602-w">8</a>]
    thereby acting as a distal gender minority stressor.<br>

    distress

    One critique is that the data are often cross-sectional. While cross-sectional data can be useful for
    demonstrating the experience of a specific group of participants and should not be discounted outright, there are
    also longitudinal and population-based studies showing benefits to GAC in youth, specifically regarding increased
    well-being and reduction in gender dysphoria,

    [<a href="#10.23750/abm.v91i1.9244">32</a>]
    In addition to the effectiveness of these treatments in reducing distress, studies also indicate that GAC for TGD

    Rates of detransition are very low and do not warrant blanket bans of interventions that effectively address gender

    A wide scope of results was found on the prevalence of suicide-related outcomes once transgender persons got access
    to desired surgical affirming procedures. The most unanimous finding was the decrease in suicidal ideation post-GAS,
    with some studies adding the relevance of undergoing more than one surgery and highlighting the impact of breast
    surgery over other procedures. Results on the prevalence of suicide attempts were less promising, with some studies
    showing a decrease post-GAS and others showing no relevant variation or a higher prevalence than the general
    population. The inconsistency of results could be explained by the studies’ small sample sizes, variety in
    methodology, poor choice of control groups, lack of evaluation of external stressors and dismissal of
    surgery-related outcomes. Such variability makes it difficult to draw conclusions and predict the success of
    surgical interventions. Conclusions on GAS’ influence on suicide deaths cannot be drawn due to the low quantity and
    quality of evidence.
    It should be noted that this review focused solely on suicide-related outcomes, considering most psychological
    outcomes have already been shown to be improved by GAS. When deciding whether to submit a patient to surgery, not
    only the suicidality aspects should be considered, but each patient’s characteristics and the prospect of an
    enhancement in the quality of life.

    disinformation has become a tool for authorities to limit gender-affirming health care (GAC) for transgender and
    gender-expansive youth who experience gender dysphoria<br>
    Medical evidence establishes that transgender and gender-diverse identities are valid, that gender dysphoria is
    real, and that GAC is safe and effective when provided in accordance with guidelines issued by, among others, the
    World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society.7,8 GAC for youth is
    supported by every relevant major medical association, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American
    Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.9–11 Although legal
    authorities have the resources to consult the science and draft health policy that aligns with medical consensus,
    promoters of GAC bans have ignored or mischaracterized the scientific evidence.12,13 These legal authorities have
    erroneously contended that transgender identities are the product of mental illness and social contagion, that
    gender dysphoria in adolescence resolves spontaneously, that GAC is forced onto patients by physicians, and that it
    is experimental and dangerous.

    there is evidence that denying such care results in significant harm to children and meets diagnostic criteria for
    medical neglect<br>
    The benefits of GAC, most notably on mental health, self-esteem, and development, outweigh the risks in the majority
    of circumstances. GAC is, for many, lifesaving. Research highlights how transgender youth disproportionately
    experience negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and suicidality.12 However, when children
    are supported in their gender identities and have access to GAC, they have better mental health outcomes.12,13 Some
    studies demonstrate that appropriate GAC, in the context of caregiver support, entirely mitigates the increased risk
    of depression and suicidal ideation for TGD youth.12<br>
    Denying GAC not only represents medical neglect, but it is also state-sanctioned emotional abuse.<br>
    Studies have shown there are direct negative health consequences for TGD individuals as a result of these bans and
    associated negative social media attention.4,15–17 These policies and the media coverage of them have been shown to
    undermine TGD children’s sense of self-worth and psychological well-being,2 and are consistent with state-sanctioned
    emotional abuse.
