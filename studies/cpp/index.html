    Depot gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (GnRHa) therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with
    central precocious puberty (CPP). It is still unclear whether long-term exposure to GnRHa is associated with
    impaired reproductive function in adulthood.
    The present study was performed on 46 women, former CPP patients, 12.5 ± 3.7 years after the discontinuation of
    treatment with depot GnRHa. In a structured interview, we assessed general health status, clinical signs possibly
    associated with hyperandrogenism, menstrual cycle, gynaecological diseases and reproductive function. It appears
    that long-term treatment with depot GnRHa is safe and does not impair reproductive function. The risk of former CPP
    patients to develop hirsutism and/or polycystic ovary syndrome does not seem to be increased compared to the normal
    population but this issue needs to be addressed in further long-term follow-up studies.
