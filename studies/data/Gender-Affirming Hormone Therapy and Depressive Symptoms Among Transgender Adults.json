  "summary": "GAHT = ↓ depression",
  "description": "The TGD patients prescribed GAHT had a 15% lower risk of past 2-week moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms across follow-up, compared with those not prescribed GAHT.<br> In this cohort study, being prescribed GAHT was associated with lower rates of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms in this study of diverse TGD primary care patients from FQHCs. Findings support the mental health&ndash;promoting role of GAHT and contribute to the evidence base that GAHT is a medically necessary treatment that improves mental health outcomes longitudinally for TGD people for those who want it",
