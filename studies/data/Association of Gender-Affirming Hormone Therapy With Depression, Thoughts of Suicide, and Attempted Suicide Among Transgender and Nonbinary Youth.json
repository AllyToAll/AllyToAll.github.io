  "summary": "GAHT = less depression, less suicidality",
  "description": "Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression and seriously considering suicide compared to those who wanted GAHT but did not receive it. For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression and of a past-year suicide attempt. Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth. Our results indicate significant relationships between receipt of GAHT and lower suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth.",
