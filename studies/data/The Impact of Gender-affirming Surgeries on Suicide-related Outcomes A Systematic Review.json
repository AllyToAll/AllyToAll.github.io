  "description": "A wide scope of results was found on the prevalence of suicide-related outcomes once transgender persons got access to desired surgical affirming procedures. The most unanimous finding was the decrease in suicidal ideation post-GAS, with some studies adding the relevance of undergoing more than one surgery and highlighting the impact of breast surgery over other procedures. Results on the prevalence of suicide attempts were less promising, with some studies showing a decrease post-GAS and others showing no relevant variation or a higher prevalence than the general population. The inconsistency of results could be explained by the studies’ small sample sizes, variety in methodology, poor choice of control groups, lack of evaluation of external stressors and dismissal of surgery-related outcomes. Such variability makes it difficult to draw conclusions and predict the success of surgical interventions. Conclusions on GAS’ influence on suicide deaths cannot be drawn due to the low quantity and quality of evidence. It should be noted that this review focused solely on suicide-related outcomes, considering most psychological outcomes have already been shown to be improved by GAS. When deciding whether to submit a patient to surgery, not only the suicidality aspects should be considered, but each patient’s characteristics and the prospect of an enhancement in the quality of life.",
