  "description": "Studies from a variety of settings have demonstrated that transgender youth have increased rates of depression, suicidality and self-harm, and eating disorders. While these results are troubling, the first longitudinal study of patients undergoing comprehensive therapy for gender dysphoria has shown promising data to support the notion that appropriate medical treatment for gender-variant youth can lead to improved psychological functioning. Indeed, in clinical observations outlined by Spack et al. <a href=\"#10.1542/peds.2015-3223\">[6]</a>, psychological functioning for these patients improved with medical intervention, suggesting that &ldquo;psychiatric symptoms might be secondary to a medical incongruence between mind and body, not primarily psychiatric (p423).",
