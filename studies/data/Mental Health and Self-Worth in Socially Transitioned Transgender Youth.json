  "description": "Transgender children reported depression and self-worth that did not differ from their matched-control or sibling peers, and they reported marginally higher anxiety. Compared with national averages, transgender children showed typical rates of depression and marginally higher rates of anxiety. Parents similarly reported that their transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups and rated their transgender children as having equivalent levels of depression<br> These findings are in striking contrast to previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially transitioned, which found very high rates of depression and anxiety.",
