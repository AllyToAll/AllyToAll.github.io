  "description": "disinformation has become a tool for authorities to limit gender-affirming health care (GAC) for transgender and gender-expansive youth who experience gender dysphoria Medical evidence establishes that transgender and gender-diverse identities are valid, that gender dysphoria is real, and that GAC is safe and effective when provided in accordance with guidelines issued by, among others, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society.7, 8 GAC for youth is supported by every relevant major medical association, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.9–11 Although legal authorities have the resources to consult the science and draft health policy that aligns with medical consensus, promoters of GAC bans have ignored or mischaracterized the scientific evidence.12,13 These legal authorities have erroneously contended that transgender identities are the product of mental illness and social contagion, that gender dysphoria in adolescence resolves spontaneously, that GAC is forced onto patients by physicians, and that it is experimental and dangerous.",
