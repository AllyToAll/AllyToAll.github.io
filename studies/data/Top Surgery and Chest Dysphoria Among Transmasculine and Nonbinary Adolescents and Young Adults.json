  "description": "We found that top surgery was associated with significant improvement in chest dysphoria (measured by the CDM) 3 months postoperatively; patients receiving surgery exhibited substantial decreases in CDM from presurgery to postsurgery and their reductions in CDM were significantly greater than those for patients who did not undergo top surgery. Top surgery also led to significant improvements in gender congruence (TCS) and body image satisfaction (BIS) at 3 months postoperatively. Surgical complications were minimal and comparable with those in adult patients<br> Top surgery in TGNB DFAB AYA is associated with low complication rates. Top surgery is associated with improved chest dysphoria, gender congruence, and body image satisfaction in this age group.",
