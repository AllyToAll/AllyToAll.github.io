  "description": "Compared with standard care, the intervention group had a decrease in gender dysphoria, a clinically significant decrease in depression, and a significant decrease in suicidality. Resolution of suicidality assessed by PHQ-9 item 9 occurred in 11 individuals (52%) with immediate testosterone commencement compared with 1 (5%) receiving standard care. In this open-label randomized clinical trial of testosterone therapy in transgender and gender-diverse adults, immediate testosterone compared with no treatment significantly reduced gender dysphoria, depression, and suicidality in transgender and gender-diverse individuals desiring testosterone therapy.",
