  "description": "there is evidence that denying such care results in significant harm to children and meets diagnostic criteria for medical neglect. The benefits of GAC, most notably on mental health, self-esteem, and development, outweigh the risks in the majority of circumstances. GAC is, for many, lifesaving. Research highlights how transgender youth disproportionately experience negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and suicidality.12 However, when children are supported in their gender identities and have access to GAC, they have better mental health outcomes.12, 13 Some studies demonstrate that appropriate GAC, in the context of caregiver support, entirely mitigates the increased risk of depression and suicidal ideation for TGD youth.12<br> Denying GAC not only represents medical neglect, but it is also state-sanctioned emotional abuse.<br> Studies have shown there are direct negative health consequences for TGD individuals as a result of these bans and associated negative social media attention.4, 15–17 These policies and the media coverage of them have been shown to undermine TGD children’s sense of self-worth and psychological well-being,2 and are consistent with state-sanctioned emotional abuse.",
